FORKING REPOSITORY:
Hello Team

If you would like to make a fork copy of the repository:

Click on the repo
Top Right hand corner, click the Fork Button(this will create a fork copy of repo.
Now copy the clone URL on the right hand sidebar of the fork repo screen.
Open Command Line, and cd into wherever you want to place the forked repo.
In the command line type git clone *paste in the clone URL here* then hit Enter.(this creates a cloned copy of the fork onto your local computer.
on Github go to original Repo(Ari’s) and copy the clone URL.
In command line cd into the cloned fork repo.
Type git remote add upstream *paste Ari’s clone URL here* then Enter. (This creates a remote that links to Ari’s repo called “upstream”).
Make changes to the local cloned copy of the repo and save.
Once you are happy with the changes, go back to command line, cd into your local fork repo(if not already on it)
Type git add .  then Enter (after doing this you can type git status and Enter to check the correct changes are showing up).
Type git commit -m “*Message on changes you made and time/date” then Enter.
Now type git push origin master then Enter. (this will upload the changes back onto the fork repo in github)
Once that is done, hop on to your forked repo page on GitHub and click Pull requests on the right hand sidebar.
Then click new pull request > create a pull request 
Make sure ari’s repo is showing as the base fork and your forked repo is showing as the head fork.
Click Create pull request. Then a request should be sent to Ari to merge the changes.
if you want to make more changes to the repo, go to your local copy, and perform a git pull upstream master while cd’d into your local fork repo folder.(always do this to keep your forked repo updated with the original repo(Ari’s Repo).
